    <h1>Mac and Windows: The Pros and Cons</h1>
    <p>
      The Mac versus PC debate has been going on for a long time. Ultimately, it
      comes down to personal preference; what you like and what you want to do
      with your system.
    </p>

    <h2>Operating systems</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the two main computer systems
      come from the operating systems. OS X® and Microsoft® Windows® work
      differently. Depending on what you want to do, one might be better than
      the other, but it comes down to what you are comfortable with.
    </p>
    <h2>Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>
      When trying to decide between a Mac and a PC, one thing to consider is the
      other devices you have, such as; mobile phones, tablets, gaming consoles,
      Apple TV®, and other computers. Although it is possible to have a mix of
      operating systems, Apple® products are designed to work together, and
      Windows and Android™ products are designed to work together, along with
      PlayStation® and Xbox®. Some people dislike the extra work to get the
      different devices to talk to each other. <br />With Boot Camp®, it is
      possible to install Windows on a Mac, then switch between the operating
      systems according to what you need to do.
    </p>
    <h2>Mac Advantages</h2>
    <p>
      Macs have been associated with high-powered graphic design for some time.
      This is due to the design of the products themselves. Apple products are
      visually appealing, and are sometimes purchased for how they look. There
      are tools and apps for graphic design that are also Mac-only. Most of the
      big names in design software are now made for Windows, but the perception
      remains that Macs are what you need for graphic design. <br />Because
      there are fewer Apple products compared to PCs, there are fewer viruses
      created for OS X. In addition, because Apple tightly controls the software
      on its devices, there is much less bloatware installed on new systems.

      <br />Apple’s customer service is well known for being better. Because
      there are so many possible PC makers, it’s hard to do a direct comparison,
      but in general, Apple does a great job of backing up their products.

      <br />Macs tend to have new innovations incorporated into their design
      faster than PCs. Because there is just one manufacturer of Apple products,
      they can move more quickly when there is a hardware innovation like USB-C.

      <br />Because Mac users are a minority, Apple has been careful to make
      sure that their products can work with Windows software. As a result, Macs
      can read drives that are formatted for Windows and can often convert
      Windows software to something that is compatible with OS X.
    </p>
    <h2>PC Advantages</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest PC advantage is cost. Because there are so many PC makers, it
      is possible to find a wide range of devices at different price points.
      Only the most high-powered and expensive PCs approach Apple products’
      price point.

      <br />Although Apple is trying to catch up, PCs have more opportunities
      for touch screens. With Windows 8 and Windows 10 created with touch
      screens in mind; laptops can convert to tablets, desktops can use touch
      screen monitors, and tablets can be used like computers.

      <br />Windows PCs have far more software created for them. While many
      major software makers produce multiple versions of their software, some
      don’t, expecting Apple to fill any holes in the market with proprietary
      software.
